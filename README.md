# K-Nearest Neighbors in Scala

Just messing around with Scala and decided to implement the KNN machine learning algorithm.

## Run on your own system 

1. Download the repo

        git clone https://github.com/dbusteed/knn-scala
        cd knn-scala

2. Update `fileName` at `src/main/scala/Main.scala:21`

3. Package and run the `jar` file

        sbt package
        scala target/scala-2.13/knn_2.13-1.0.jar

## Example
```
Enter height: 71
Enter weight: 175

Predicted gender: male
```
